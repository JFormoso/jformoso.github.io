## Overview

I am currently a Tenured Researcher at CIIPME-CONICET and serve as the Impact Measurement Coordinator and Instructor at MetaDocencia, where I advocate for Open Science across Latin America and the Caribbean. I am actively involved in communities of practice that support data science education, including co-organizing the Buenos Aires chapter of R-Ladies. I have over a decade of teaching experience as a faculty member at the University of Buenos Aires and more than five years of experience designing and teaching courses on statistics, R programming, and data science. Additionally, I contribute to open educational resources by developing tutorials, workshops, and course materials for teaching R programming, data science, and statistics in Spanish. I am also an Instructor and Trainer for The Carpentries and RStudio (now Posit).
