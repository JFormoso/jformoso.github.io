    "text": "A principios de este mes, tuve la oportunidad de asistir a Khipu, la conferencia de Inteligencia Artificial (IA) y Aprendizaje Autom√°tico m√°s grande de Am√©rica Latina.\nEste a√±o fue la cuarta edici√≥n de Khipu y la primera en realizarse fuera de Uruguay. Tuvo lugar en Santiago de Chile, reuniendo a cientos de investigadores, profesionales y estudiantes de toda la regi√≥n (y fuera de ella tambi√©n).\nKhipu es mucho m√°s que una conferencia: es un espacio para aprender, compartir y construir comunidad en torno a la IA en Am√©rica Latina. El programa est√° cuidadosamente dise√±ado para ofrecer contenidos a una una audiencia muy variada. Las charlas siguen una estructura progresiva: las sesiones iniciales fueron m√°s generales y accesibles, aunque rigurosas y siempre a cargo de personas expertas, y, a medida que fue avanzando la semana, los contenidos se volvieron m√°s t√©cnico y especializado.\nPor ejemplo, algunas de las charlas que m√°s disfrut√© fueron Fundamentos de Machine Learning y Deep Learning I por Jorge P√©rez, Fundamentos de ML y DL II por Alfredo Canziani, y Fundamentos de Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural por Isabelle Augenstein. El segundo d√≠a, Petar Veliƒçkoviƒá dio una excelente presentaci√≥n sobre Geometric Deep Learning. El jueves tuvimos sesiones paralelas sobre ciberseguridad, aprendizaje autom√°tico en econom√≠a, visi√≥n por computadora, IA y derechos humanos, entre otros temas.\nLa conferencia tambi√©n ofreci√≥ tutoriales de distintos niveles de dificultad sobre temas como aprendizaje autom√°tico, procesamiento de lenguaje natural, √©tica en IA, entre otros. Los materiales estaban cuidadosamente preparados, incluyendo Jupyter notebooks bien documentadas que pod√≠as llevarte y seguir explorando por tu cuenta. Tambi√©n hubo sesiones de p√≥sters, donde las y los asistentes pod√≠an presentar sus trabajos y recibir feedback en un ambiente amigable.\nUna de las cosas que m√°s me llam√≥ la atenci√≥n fue el clima c√°lido y amigable. Es un excelente lugar para conocer personas que trabajan con IA en distintos sectores, explorar colaboraciones y sentirse parte de una comunidad latinoamericana en crecimiento."

No lo s√© con certeza‚Äîquiz√°s deber√≠a haberle preguntado a alguien del comit√© organizador‚Äîpero pienso que se valora tu potencial para compartir lo que aprendas y actuar como multiplicador en tu comunidad.

Pero, sobre todo, lo que m√°s me qued√≥ fue la dimensi√≥n humana: las limitaciones de las tecnolog√≠as actuales, y c√≥mo las personas reflexionan cr√≠ticamente sobre ellas y trabajan para superarlas.\n¬øQu√© pasa cuando trabaj√°s con datos sensibles y privados que no se pueden compartir con modelos grandes en plataformas externas, y tu instituci√≥n tiene infraestructura y financiamiento limitados? Proyectos como los que presentaron Leonardo Lombardi (QuantIT), Aiala Ros√° (Universidad de la Rep√∫blica), Victor Mireless (UNAM) y Juan Reutter (PUC, Chile) sobre IA y Derechos Humanos son un claro ejemplo.\n¬øQu√© pasa si necesit√°s un modelo cuyas decisiones sean comprensibles/explicables? Por ejemplo, en el √°mbito m√©dico, donde tanto profesionales como pacientes deber√≠an poder entender la l√≥gica detr√°s de un diagn√≥stico? Charlas como la de Ren√© Vidal (Universidad de Pensilvania) sobre explicabilidad abordaron ese tema.\nOtras sesiones exploraron temas cr√≠ticos como los sesgos y la gobernanza de la IA, destacando la importancia de la equidad y la transparencia en el desarrollo e implementaci√≥n de modelos. Como parte del cierre, hubo una muy interesante sesi√≥n sobre equidad de g√©nero y mujeres en la IA a cargo de Catherine D‚ÄôIgnazio (MIT) e Ivana Feldgeber (DataGenero).\nEn resumen, un recordatorio de que la IA, como cualquier tecnolog√≠a, no es neutral. Refleja los valores, prioridades y perspectivas de quienes la desarrollan. Por eso son tan importantes espacios como Khipu: para asegurar que Am√©rica Latina no sea solo consumidora de IA, sino tambi√©n protagonista en dar forma a su futuro.\nPod√©s ver la mayor√≠a de las charlas en el canal de YouTube de Khipu."

    "text": "In September 2023, I had the opportunity to attend the NumFocus DISC Unconference‚Äîa gathering dedicated to creating a more equitable open-source data science community. As someone committed to promoting open practices in research, data, and scientific computing in Latin America, this event offered a unique space to connect with leaders in these fields and work together on meaningful projects.\nThe open-source community remains relatively homogenous, which limits its potential. Events like the DISC Unconf provide a space to brainstorm how to make it more representative and inclusve. My role at the event was as a contributor, and I focused on a project that resonates deeply with my experiences as a researcher from the global south: Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn‚Äôt ask."

    "text": "Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn‚Äôt ask\nThis project aimed to tackle a critical barrier faced by researchers from underrepresented regions when applying for grants from the global north. For many of us, the application process often feels foreign and inaccessible due to cultural and systemic differences. These challenges discourage talented researchers from applying, perpetuating inequality in access to resources.\nThe project‚Äôs goal was to design a curriculum and coaching program to support potential grantees in navigating the grant process. From identifying suitable funding opportunities to crafting proposals, creating budgets, and building collaborations, the program seeks to level the playing field and enable fairer engagement.\nI collaborated with an incredible team, including Laura Aci√≥n, Jessica Greene, Barbara Wilk, Kate Hertweck, Yo Yehudi, Tania Allard, and Mariana Meireles. Working alongside individuals from diverse backgrounds was inspiring. Their varied perspectives challenged my thinking and enriched the project in ways I hadn‚Äôt anticipated."

The brainstorming sessions and collaborative work stood out as particularly productive and inspiring.\nAs a researcher from Argentina, I appreciated the opportunity to share my experiences and perspectives. One key takeaway was the importance of having participants from underrepresented regions in decision-making spaces. Solutions to our challenges must include our voices to be truly effective and relevant.\nI‚Äôm especially excited that the DISC Unconf 2025 will take place in S√£o Paulo, Brazil.

To this end, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the evolution of the use of the terms ‚Äúopen science‚Äù and ‚Äúopen science‚Äù over time from 2012 to the present. Where information was available, the representation of each region was studied. Finally, a social network analysis was performed to identify influential users and clusters of users and then the association of these with communities of practice was studied.\nThe recording is available here.\nMore information can be found in this blogpost."

This repository aims to centralize and map open science resources and communities in the region, enabling users to connect with local and regional initiatives, access resources, and actively participate in promoting open science practices.\nThe app is envisioned as not only a useful tool for researchers and organizations but also a bridge to foster collaboration and visibility for open science across Latin America.\nAn initial version can be found here.\nYou can find the presentation slides here."

Many attendees shared that they were unfamiliar with some of the conferences and events we presented or didn‚Äôt realize they could apply for financial support or travel grants to participate. This realization was empowering for many, as it helped them see these opportunities as something within their reach.\nThe diversity in the room was amazing‚Äîwe connected with people working in areas like census data, health data, and academic research. There were attendees who were just starting their journey with R, as well as seasoned users eager to share their experiences. The feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive, and the enthusiasm in the room reinforced the importance of creating spaces like this.\n\nWe wrapped up the evening with an end-of-year toast and a networking session, which allowed us to continue building connections in a relaxed and celebratory atmosphere. üçæ\nIf you missed the talk, you can check out the slides here: Slides\nüíú Stay connected with the R-Ladies Buenos Aires network: üê¶ Twitter: @RLadiesBA üåê Website: https://rladiesba.netlify.app/\nLet‚Äôs continue growing together, discovering opportunities, and making the R community an even more inclusive and enriching space! üí™üíú"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Earlier this month, I had the chance to attend Khipu, the largest Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning gathering in Latin America.\nThis year marked the fourth edition of Khipu‚Äîand the first to take place outside of Uruguay. It was held in Santiago, Chile, bringing together hundreds of researchers, professionals, and students from across the region and beyond.\nKhipu is more than just a conference: it‚Äôs a space for learning, sharing, and building community around AI in Latin America. The program is thoughtfully designed to offer content for a wide range of audiences. Talks follow a progressive structure: early sessions are more general and accessible, yet rigorous and engaging, and always led by experts.\nFor example, some of the opening lectures I really enjoyed were ML & DL Foundamentals I by Jorge Perez, ML & DL Foundamentals II by Alfredo Canziani and Natural Language Processing Fundamentals by Isabelle Augenstein. As the week went on, content became increasingly technical and specialized. On the second day, Petar Veliƒçkoviƒá gave a fantastic lecture on Geometric Deep Learning. By Thursday, we had parallel sessions on cybersecurity, ML in economics, computer vision, AI and human rights, among others.\nThe conference also offered tutorials at different difficulty levels on various topics such as in machine learning, natural language processing, AI ethics, or technical toolkits. Materials were carefully prepared, including well documented Jupyter notebooks you could take home and continue learning on your own. There were also poster sessions, where attendees could present their work and get feedback in a friendly environment.\nOne of the things that stood out the most to me was the welcoming and warm atmosphere. It‚Äôs a great place to meet people who are working in AI across different sectors, to explore collaborations, and to feel part of a growing Latin American AI community."

Instead, you apply, sharing your background, motivation, and what you hope to contribute or learn. If selected, you can also apply for financial support to cover travel and accommodation. The goal is to make participation accessible and remove financial barriers.\nWhat makes a good application? I‚Äôm not entirely sure‚Äîmaybe I should‚Äôve asked someone from the organizing committee‚Äîbut I believe they value your potential to share what you learn and act as a multiplier in your community. If you‚Äôre involved in teaching or in communities of practice, that‚Äôs probably a plus. If you‚Äôre working on projects that require AI and could benefit from your attendance, mention them!

But most of all, what stayed with me was the human dimension: the limitations of current technologies, and how people reflect critically on them and work to overcome them.\nWhat happens when you‚Äôre working with sensitive, private data that can‚Äôt be shared with large models on external platforms, and your institution has limited infrastructure and funding? Projects like the ones presented by Leonardo Lombardi (QuantIT), Aiala Ros√° (Universidad de la Rep√∫blica), Victor Mireless (UNAM) and Juan Reutter (PUC, Chile) on AI and Human Rights are a clear example.\nWhat if you need a model whose decisions are understandable and accountable‚Äîlike in a medical setting, where both doctor and patient should be able to understand the logic behind a diagnosis? Talks like the one by Ren√© Vidal (University of Pennsylvania) on explainability touched on that.\nOther sessions explored critical topics such as bias and AI governance, highlighting the importance of fairness and transparency in model development and deployment. As part of the closing event, Catherine D‚ÄôIgnazio (MIT) and Ivana Feldgeber (DataGenero) delivered a powerful session on gender equity and women in AI.\nBasically, a reminder that AI, like any technology, is not neutral. It reflects the values, priorities, and perspectives of those who build it. That‚Äôs why spaces like Khipu matter: to ensure Latin America is not just a consumer of AI, but also a key player in shaping its future.\nYou can watch most of the talks on Khipu‚Äôs youtube channel"
