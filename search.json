As someone committed to promoting open practices in research, data, and scientific computing in Latin America, this event offered a unique space to connect with leaders in these fields and work together on meaningful projects.\nThe open-source community remains relatively homogenous, which limits its potential. Events like the DISC Unconf provide a space to brainstorm how to make it more representative and inclusve. My role at the event was as a contributor, and I focused on a project that resonates deeply with my experiences as a researcher from the global south: Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn’t ask."

    "text": "Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn’t ask\nThis project aimed to tackle a critical barrier faced by researchers from underrepresented regions when applying for grants from the global north. For many of us, the application process often feels foreign and inaccessible due to cultural and systemic differences. These challenges discourage talented researchers from applying, perpetuating inequality in access to resources.\nThe project’s goal was to design a curriculum and coaching program to support potential grantees in navigating the grant process. From identifying suitable funding opportunities to crafting proposals, creating budgets, and building collaborations, the program seeks to level the playing field and enable fairer engagement.\nI collaborated with an incredible team, including Laura Ación, Jessica Greene, Barbara Wilk, Kate Hertweck, Yo Yehudi, Tania Allard, and Mariana Meireles. Working alongside individuals from diverse backgrounds was inspiring. Their varied perspectives challenged my thinking and enriched the project in ways I hadn’t anticipated."

The brainstorming sessions and collaborative work stood out as particularly productive and inspiring.\nAs a researcher from Argentina, I appreciated the opportunity to share my experiences and perspectives. One key takeaway was the importance of having participants from underrepresented regions in decision-making spaces. Solutions to our challenges must include our voices to be truly effective and relevant.\nI’m especially excited that the DISC Unconf 2025 will take place in São Paulo, Brazil. This move will bring more Latin American researchers to the table and foster regional collaboration."

This repository aims to centralize and map open science resources and communities in the region, enabling users to connect with local and regional initiatives, access resources, and actively participate in promoting open science practices.\nThe app is envisioned as not only a useful tool for researchers and organizations but also a bridge to foster collaboration and visibility for open science across Latin America.\nAn initial version can be found here.\nYou can find the presentation slides here."

    "text": "Workshops and events\nThe workshops at Posit Conf were a major highlight. I attended the Build a Dashboard with Quarto workshop, led by the amazing Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, a developer educator at Posit, PBC. Mine’s teaching style is incredible, making the process of creating Quarto dashboards approachable and fun. If you’re curious about the workshop, check out the materials here.\nAnother standout moment was participating in the Tidyverse Developer Day. This event was an introduction to contributing to the Tidyverse ecosystem and showcased the supportive spirit of the community. Everyone was eager to help, share their thoughts, and encourage new contributors. You can read more about it here.\nThe conference was filled with inspiring talks and sessions, many of which focused on Quarto. These sessions directly connected to my professional work, and I’ve already shared some of what I learned in a workshop with R-Ladies Buenos Aires. If you know Spanish, you can check it out here. We’re even planning a follow-up workshop next year to explore Quarto dashboards in more depth!"

    "text": "Building Community\nPosit Conf was not just about learning—it was also about connecting. I attended the Opportunity Scholar Lunch, where I met fellow scholars and Posit team members, including Hadley Wickham, Hannah Frick, Carlos Scheidegger, and the wonderful Kaia Cooper. The lunch was casual, fun, and an excellent chance to meet other Opportunity Scholars and our hosts at Posit, PBC.\nAnother memorable moment was meeting members of the rainbowR community, which supports LGBTQ+ individuals in the R community. Sharing stories and experiences over lunch with this group was both heartwarming and inspiring.\nThe atmosphere at Posit::conf(2024) was everything I hoped for. I met R enthusiasts from all over the world, spanning diverse disciplines, from academia to industry. It was a reminder of the incredible reach and versatility of the R community."
