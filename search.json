    "text": "The presentation ‚ÄúA Shiny App for Mapping Open-Science Communities, Organizations & Events in Latin America‚Äù highlighted the challenges of limited resources and spaces in Spanish for open science in Latin America, as well as the difficulty of identifying active communities and networks practicing open science in the region.\nIt emphasized the lack of a centralized, up-to-date repository to facilitate access to key information about resources, events, and communities, which hinders collaboration and knowledge exchange.\nAs a solution, the presentation proposed the development of a collaborative repository accessible through a Shiny application. This repository aims to centralize and map open science resources and communities in the region, enabling users to connect with local and regional initiatives, access resources, and actively participate in promoting open science practices.\nThe app is envisioned as not only a useful tool for researchers and organizations but also a bridge to foster collaboration and visibility for open science across Latin America.\nAn initial version can be found here.\nYou can find the presentation slides here."

As someone committed to promoting open practices in research, data, and scientific computing in Latin America, this event offered a unique space to connect with leaders in these fields and work together on meaningful projects.\nThe open-source community remains relatively homogenous, which limits its potential. Events like the DISC Unconf provide a space to brainstorm how to make it more representative and inclusve. My role at the event was as a contributor, and I focused on a project that resonates deeply with my experiences as a researcher from the global south: Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn‚Äôt ask."

For many of us, the application process often feels foreign and inaccessible due to cultural and systemic differences. These challenges discourage talented researchers from applying, perpetuating inequality in access to resources.\nThe project‚Äôs goal was to design a curriculum and coaching program to support potential grantees in navigating the grant process. From identifying suitable funding opportunities to crafting proposals, creating budgets, and building collaborations, the program seeks to level the playing field and enable fairer engagement.\nI collaborated with an incredible team, including Laura Aci√≥n, Jessica Greene, Barbara Wilk, Kate Hertweck, Yo Yehudi, Tania Allard, and Mariana Meireles.

It was held in Santiago, Chile, bringing together hundreds of researchers, professionals, and students from across the region and beyond.\nKhipu is more than just a conference: it‚Äôs a space for learning, sharing, and building community around AI in Latin America. The program is thoughtfully designed to offer content for a wide range of audiences. Talks follow a progressive structure: early sessions are more general and accessible, yet rigorous and engaging, and always led by experts.\nFor example, some of the opening lectures I really enjoyed were ML & DL Foundamentals I by Jorge Perez, ML & DL Foundamentals II by Alfredo Canziani and Natural Language Processing Fundamentals by Isabelle Augenstein. As the week went on, content became increasingly technical and specialized. On the second day, Petar Veliƒçkoviƒá gave a fantastic lecture on Geometric Deep Learning. By Thursday, we had parallel sessions on cybersecurity, ML in economics, computer vision, AI and human rights, among others. This structure made the event a rich learning experience‚Äîwhether you were just starting out or already deep in the field.\nThe conference also offered tutorials on various topics and at different difficulty levels. Whether you were interested in machine learning, natural language processing, AI ethics, or technical toolkits, there was a hands-on session for you. Materials were carefully prepared, including excellent, very well documented Jupyter notebooks, so you could take them home and continue learning on your own. There were also poster sessions, where attendees could present their work, share ideas, get feedback, and showcase projects in a friendly environment.\nOne of the things that stood out the most to me was the welcoming and warm atmosphere. It‚Äôs a great place to meet people who are working in AI across different sectors, to explore collaborations, and to feel part of a growing Latin American AI community."

    "text": "‚úçÔ∏è Want to attend the next event?\nYou might be wondering how to attend the next Khipu. Unlike many conferences, you don‚Äôt simply register and pay a fee. Instead, you apply, sharing your background, motivation, and what you hope to contribute or learn. If selected, you can also apply for financial support to cover travel and accommodation. The goal is to make participation accessible and remove financial barriers.\nWhat makes a good application? I‚Äôm not entirely sure‚Äîmaybe I should‚Äôve asked someone from the organizing committee‚Äîbut I believe they value your potential to share what you learn and act as a multiplier in your community. If you‚Äôre involved in teaching or in communities of practice, that‚Äôs probably a plus. If you‚Äôre working on projects that require AI and could benefit from your attendance, mention them! Include links to relevant resources or repositories."

    "text": "üåê Language access\nA significant limitation: everything is in English. This year, the organizing team added automatic captioning, which helps, but it‚Äôs still not an event I would recommend to someone with no English at all. That said, the team is clearly aware of this barrier. Khipu is made for Latin Americans, and there‚Äôs a genuine interest in making it more accessible for non-English speakers in the future."

    "text": "What I took with me\nI learned a lot, met incredible people, drank way too much coffee and ate way too much sugar. But most of all, what stayed with me was the human dimension: the limitations of current technologies, and how people reflect critically on them and work to overcome them.\nWhat happens when you‚Äôre working with sensitive, private data that can‚Äôt be shared with large models on external platforms, and your institution has limited infrastructure and funding? Projects like the ones presented by Leonardo Lombardi (QuantIT), Aiala Ros√° (Universidad de la Rep√∫blica), Victor Mireless (UNAM) and Juan Reutter (PUC, Chile) on AI and Human Rights are a clear example.\nWhat if you need a model whose decisions are understandable and accountable‚Äîlike in a medical setting, where both doctor and patient should be able to understand the logic behind a diagnosis? Talks like the one by Ren√© Vidal (University of Pennsylvania) on explainability touched on that.\nOther sessions explored critical topics such as bias and AI governance, highlighting the importance of fairness and transparency in model development and deployment. As part of the closing event, Catherine D‚ÄôIgnazio (MIT) and Ivana Feldgeber (DataGenero) delivered a powerful session on gender equity and women in AI.\nBasically, the reminder that AI, like any technology, is not neutral. It reflects the values, priorities, and perspectives of those who build it. That‚Äôs why spaces like Khipu matter: to ensure Latin America is not just a consumer of AI, but also a key player in shaping its future.\nYou can watch most of the talks on Khipu‚Äôs youtube channel"
