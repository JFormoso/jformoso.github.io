The session showcases MetaDocencia's initiative to make information available regarding resources, events, workshops, funding opportunities, and open science communities in Latin America through a collaborative repository. This repository will be available to anyone who wants to access resources on open science, get in touch with other regional and local actors in Latin America, or participate in the dissemination of open practices. This project was presented in [Code for All's 2023 Summit](https://codeforall.org/summit-2023) (september 18-21).
