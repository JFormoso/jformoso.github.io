title: Communities of practice in Latin America and their influence on the dissemination of open science
---

In this talk, which was presented in the csv,conf 2023, we analize what is the role of communities of practice in the dissemination and implementation of open science practices in general, and specifically, in the Latin American region. To this end, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the evolution of the use of the terms "open science" and "open science" over time from 2012 to the present. Where information was available, the representation of each region was studied. Finally, a social network analysis was performed to identify influential users and clusters of users and then the association of these with communities of practice was studied.
