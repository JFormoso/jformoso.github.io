This is a 2 hour workshop for R-Ladies Buenos Aires about manipulation of tabular data with **dplyr**. This is one of the core packages of the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data science. It provides a set of functions that make it easier to filter, arrange, summarize, and transform data. Together with the pipe operator (%>%), they allows users to chain operations together in a clear and concise way.
