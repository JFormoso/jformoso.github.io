I am part of the development team for [ScienceCore: Climate Risk](https://github.com/ScienceCore/climaterisk), a learning module under [NASA's Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/tops/). This project aims to teach participants how to identify, analyze, visualize, and report on climate data available through the **NASA Earthdata Cloud** to assess risks related to wildfires, droughts, and floods in the context of climate change.

In collaboration with [MetaDocencia]() and [2i2c](), we are creating open, reproducible, and accessible materials in both English and Spanish. The module leverages open-source tools to promote open science practices and cloud-based intensive computing. It empowers learners to analyze regional and global environmental risks using open science-based, reproducible workflows.

The materials can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ScienceCore/climaterisk) and this [Jupyter book](https://sciencecore.github.io/climaterisk/).
