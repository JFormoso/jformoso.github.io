title: The Carpentries and MetaDocencia's Instructor Training
---

During 2024, I participated as a trainer in the context of Intructor Training with The Carpentries curriculum. Instructor Training familiarizes trainees with evidence-based teaching practices, helps them develop strategies for fostering a positive learning environment in workshops, and offers opportunities to practice and enhance their teaching skills.
