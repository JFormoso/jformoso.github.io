In 2023, Irene and I received an award to participate in the [UCLA-IMLS Open Science for Librarians Collaborative Lesson Development Workshop](https://ucla-imls-open-sci.info/), a project sponsored by The Carpentries. This opportunity provided us with specialized training to develop our proposed lesson, "A Path to Open, Inclusive, and Collaborative Science for Librarians". 

During the workshop, we gained insights into lesson design and community-driven curriculum development. The program emphasized inclusivity and collaboration. 
As a result of this workshop, weâ€™ve been working on the lesson, which is now available in a Pre-Alpha state. You can check out the progress:
